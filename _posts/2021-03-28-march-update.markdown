It's been a while since my last update, but a good amount of things in my life
have changed since then. I started a position at a new company in January doing
mobile development again, and have been loving the worlf of Swift ever since.

Learning the world of RxSwift has been a bit of a challenge to start, but I think
I'm getting the hang of it now.

And to all who celebrate, Happy Easter!
